          <h2>Treatment</h2>
          <p>Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare provider about possible options. </p>
          <p>There are effective treatments for moderate and severe depression. Health-care providers may offer psychological treatments such as behavioural activation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), or antidepressant medication such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).</p>
          <p>Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences. Different psychological treatment formats for consideration include individual and/or group face-to-face psychological treatments delivered by professionals and supervised lay therapists.  </p>

They’ll talk to you for as long as you want, to help ensure that you get the help you need.</p>
