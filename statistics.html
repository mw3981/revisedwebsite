          <h2>A Concerning Trend</h2>
          <p>Young people are dying from suicide at record rates. The suicide rate among people aged 10 to 24 increased 56% between 2007 and 2017, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
          <p>The new data suggests Gen Z — or the generation of Americans born during 1997 onward  — might be seeing a mental health crisis even worse than that faced by the older millennial generation. Since 2014, millennials (or people who turned 23 to 38 in 2019) have seen a 47% increase in major-depression diagnoses. "Deaths of despair," or dying from suicide, alcohol, and drugs, increased in the millennial population in the last 10 years, and they are more likely to report feeling lonely than other generations. </p>
          <p>Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 24 in 2017.</p>

          <p>Since 2014, millennials (or people who turned 23 to 38 in 2019) have seen a 47% increase in major-depression diagnoses. "Deaths of despair," or dying from suicide, alcohol, and drugs, increased in the millennial population in the last 10 years, and they are more likely to report feeling lonely than other generations.</p>
          <p>For Gen Z, the mental illness crisis continues. In 2017, 13% of teens reported having experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, Pew Research Center reported. In 2007, when more millennials were teens, that number was just 8%.</p>
          <p>Social media might be fueling the increase in mental illness, as Gen Z is the first truly digital generation. Pew Research Center found 45% of teens aged 13 to 17 said they use the internet "almost constantly." Over-use of social media can cause loneliness, depression, and anxiety, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America reported.</p>
